"""
A simple script to take all non OWL nodes (not :Class, :Property, or :Individual)
and all non-owl edges (not :Related, :INSTANCEOF, :SUBCLASSOF)
and move them from KB to prod.
"""

# Description of the problem:
# Nodes in KB can be uniquely identified by iri
# Nodes in prod cannot be uniquely identified by iri
# But can be uniquely identified by some combination of neo4J label + iri
# Labels are largely but not completely matched between KB and prod.
# Loading edges only to correct prod nodes therefore requires specifying edge labels in merge.
# Merge strategy 1:
# Merge requires all labels on nodes retrieved from KB to match those those on nodes with same key in prod
# Scenario 1:  Node loaded from OWL, has extra labels in KB
# KB Load will fail.
# Merge strategy 2
# If loading edge to prod loads nodes through merge => duplicate nodes.
# Solution is to align node labels from KB -> Prod prior to edge loading.
# But how to do this safely?  Can't just match on iri!
# Two options:
#   - Implement a label mover that works with match statements.  Run this with equivalent queries before
# running edge loader
#   - Break up match statement on edge mover into s, r, o chunks.  Use the s and o chunks to specify edges to move.
#     Limitation of this approach is that only simple match statements or possible
#      - with just a triple and no 'where' clause.
